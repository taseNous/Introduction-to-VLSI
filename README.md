These projects deal with the construction of VLSI integrated circuits
  - CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) technology

The process of digital design, especially in large-scale digital integrated circuits (DICs) (VLSI) is a complex sequence of 
steps, aimed to reach optimal transition from specification to implementation. These steps can be ordered in different abstract levels, 
even in the form of a pyramid. The highest levels of abstraction levels are characterised by high abstraction and concise 
descriptions. The opposite is the case in the lower deductive levels. 

These projects deal with the lowest level of abstractive drawing, called the physical level (physical design), and with the 
construction and control of geometric masks required to create after a series of processes on the semiconducting devices on a 
thin slice of silicon.
